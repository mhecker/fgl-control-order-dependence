This project implements new Algorithms for

* Nontermination   Sensitive Control Dependdnce (NTICD)
* Nontermination Insensitive Control Dependence (NTSCD)
* Decisive Order Dependence                     (DOD)
* Weak Order Dependence                         (WOD)


as well as new Algorithms for the following new Dependence notions
* Timing Sensitive Control Dependence           (TSCD)
* Timing Dependence                             (TDEP)
* Nontermination   Sensitive Order Dependdnce   (NTICD)
* Nontermination Insensitive Order Dependence   (NTSCD)

It implements various static Information Flow Control analyses based on these notions,
including

* Various improvements on Low Security Observatinal Determinism (LSOD) analyses for concurrent Programs
* An timing sensitive analysis for *micro*-architectural state; specifically: simple data caches.

This project was started at the Programming Paradigms group at the KIT, by Martin Hecker.
